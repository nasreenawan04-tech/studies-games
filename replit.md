# DapsiWow - Free Online Tools Platform

## Overview

DapsiWow is a comprehensive web platform providing 180+ free online tools across three main categories: finance, text processing, and health. The application is built as a client-side React application with no backend dependencies, focusing on providing instant, accessible tools without requiring user registration or sign-ups.

The platform emphasizes user privacy, speed, and accessibility while offering professional-grade calculators, converters, and utilities that would typically require paid software or services.

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript for type safety and modern development
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library for consistent design
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives for accessible, customizable components

### State Management
- **Global State**: React Context for theme management
- **Server State**: TanStack Query for data fetching and caching (minimal usage due to client-only nature)
- **Local State**: React hooks with localStorage integration for user preferences

### Client-Side Data Storage
- **Local Storage**: User preferences, favorites, recent tools, and calculation history
- **No Database**: All data persists client-side only, ensuring privacy
- **Custom Hooks**: Centralized localStorage management through custom hooks (use-favorites, use-recent-tools)

### Performance Optimizations
- **Code Splitting**: Lazy loading for all tool pages to reduce initial bundle size
- **Image Optimization**: Lazy loading components for images and assets
- **Caching**: Service worker implementation for offline functionality
- **Bundle Analysis**: Optimized imports and tree shaking

### Tool Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Each tool is a self-contained component with its own logic
- **Shared Components**: Reusable UI components for consistent user experience
- **Calculation Engine**: Client-side mathematical calculations with validation
- **Result Sharing**: URL-based result sharing without server storage

### SEO and Discoverability
- **Meta Tags**: Comprehensive SEO optimization with React Helmet Async
- **Structured Data**: Semantic HTML and meta tags for search engines
- **Sitemap**: Static sitemap generation for better indexing
- **Social Sharing**: Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags

### Deployment Architecture
- **Static Hosting**: Designed for deployment on Vercel, Netlify, or similar platforms
- **CDN Distribution**: All assets served through CDN for global performance
- **Progressive Web App**: Service worker and manifest for app-like experience
